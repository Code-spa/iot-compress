# SCHC Rule Generation With Naive Bayes
Generating a Static Context Header Compression Rule from Naive Bayes Probabiilty.

# *What is Naive Bayes?*
Naive Bayes is branched off of the famous Bayes Theorem. It assumes independence among each attributes. Also, the calculations are super simplified as compared to Bayes, hence it is highly computationally efficient.
